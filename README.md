# Numerical Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is the culmination of my work from a Numerical Analysis course, where I tackled mathematical problems using Python. The project demonstrates various numerical methods and techniques, along with optimized and refactored code to address specific problem-solving needs.

## Key Concepts and Techniques
- **Numerical Methods**: Implemented methods for solving mathematical problems, such as root-finding algorithms, numerical integration, differentiation, and systems of linear equations.
- **Python Programming**: Utilized Python for writing efficient and readable code that performs complex mathematical computations.
- **Code Refactoring**: Improved existing codebases by optimizing performance, enhancing readability, and making adjustments to fit unique problem constraints.
- **Customization**: Adapted and modified algorithms to meet the requirements of specific numerical challenges.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Main programming language used for implementing numerical methods and performing mathematical computations.
- **Libraries**: Utilized libraries such as NumPy and SciPy for efficient numerical operations.
